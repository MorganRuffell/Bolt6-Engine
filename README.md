# Bolt6ProgrammingTest
This is the programming test that the Bolt6.ai set me on the 09th June 2022. 
The task is to get a skeletal animation running, on something similar to an IK Bone system inside of a windows application.

I was originally going to do this in DirectX12, I struggled to setup OpenGL as I'm more used to microsofts graphics technology
rather than Khronos's. So I decided to comprimise on DirectX 11.

I had one week to do this, this is the results of that week.

Part of the task was to build this whole project from scratch, I started just with the header files from ImGui, Autodesks FBX SDK and DirectX11.
